# AIGCIQA2023
\item We propose to disentangle the human visual experience for AIGIs into three perspectives including \textbf{\textit{quality}}, \textbf{\textit{authenticity}}, and \textbf{\textit{correspondence}}.
\item Based on the above theory, we establish a novel large-scale database, \textit{i.e.,} AIGCIQA2023, to better understand the human visual preferences for AIGIs and guide the design of objective IQA models.
\item We conduct a benchmark experiment to
evaluate the performance of several current state-of-the-art IQA algorithms in measuring the quality, authenticity, and text-image correspondence of AIGIs.
